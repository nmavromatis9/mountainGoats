Weekly Status: Medical Procedure Price Checker

During our first week, we collected JSON files of medical prices for several hospitals and extracted them with python scripts into an excel file.
We also created a data dictionary describing the data. 

During the second week, we wrote a python script that created a sqlite database file. We made a first iteration of placing tasks on Trello.
We plan to continue to learn Flask and work early on milestone 4 to develop web page structure. 
We feel it is an early stage learning many new tools so progress is still somewhat slow. 
Our top priorities are to learn Flask and plan our web layout.
We plan to make a mockup of pages, and create a list of page descriptions after organizing the structure of the application.
