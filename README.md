Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom)

Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
All hospitals are required to list their prices for procedures. 
This web app aims to list the prices for common procedures for the largest hospital chains so the customer can make informed buying decisions.

Motivation: why are you working on this project?
This project is an opportunity to work in an AGILE group, and learn full stack development to create a working product.

Risks to project completion, possibly including:

new language or working environment
no prior experience working with these team members
lack of some needed resources

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
We plan to spend significant time learning new languages and toolsets, and split up this work so we all get a chance to learn.
There are many good web resources to get started learning things like JSON and Javascript.
We plan to meet weekly and assess our collaboration, in order to split up tasks and work together more cohesively.
...

Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
We plan to use scrum methodology to develop the project iteratively and incrememntally.
Each week we will plan a manageable small set of tasks to complete before the next meeting.
We will assess progress on the fly and make flexible adjustments as necessary.
It will be helpful to have a sprint task backlog to organize this process once we are more familiar with the full project scope.
