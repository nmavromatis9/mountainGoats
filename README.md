Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
Over the past few years, the federal government has issued new regulations that they hope will bring price transparency to the healthcare market.  Every hospital is now required to post to the internet in a machine-readable format the price they charge for procedures as well as the price insurers pay.  By removing secrecy from the healthcare market, the government hopes to reduce the price of healthcare.

As a proof of concept, we propose a web app that aims to list the prices for common procedures at a handful of hospitals.  Our goal is to create a database of list prices, discounted prices, Medicare prices, Medicaid prices, and prices for major private insurers (e.g. Aetna, Anthem, United Healthcare).  We expect the web app will appeal to two sets of customers.  First, patients in need of a healthcare procedure (like a colonoscopy) should be able to enter their insurer and quickly compare prices across hospitals.  Second, hospitals and insurers should find the data on the app valuable during contract negoations.  For example, if a hospital is considering joining the network of an insurer, they may want to know what the insurer pays similar hospitals.

We have preliminarily identified 4 hospital price files on the internet.  We have also found the price lists for Medicare and Colorado's Medicaid program.

Motivation: why are you working on this project?
This project is an opportunity to work in an AGILE group, and learn full stack development to create a working product.

Risks to project completion, possibly including:

new language or working environment
no prior experience working with these team members
lack of some needed resources

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
We plan to spend significant time learning new languages and toolsets, and split up this work so we all get a chance to learn.
There are many good web resources to get started learning things like JSON and Javascript.
We plan to meet weekly and assess our collaboration, in order to split up tasks and work together more cohesively.
We will address resource lacks as they occur, because they are hard to predict.

Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
We plan to use scrum methodology to develop the project iteratively and incrementally.
Each week we will plan a manageable small set of tasks to complete before the next meeting.
We will assess progress on the fly and make flexible adjustments as necessary.
It will be helpful to have a sprint task backlog to organize this process once we are more familiar with the full project scope.
