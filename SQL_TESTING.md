#### List of Tables
Our website will utilize two sqlite databases consisting of 5 tables total.  The first database is named "hospital.db" and contains the tables: tblHospitalPrices, tblInsurer, tblHospitals, and tblCPT_Codes.  This database contains the information that will be displayed to the user on the website.  The second database is named "login.db" and contains one table, users.  This database is used to keep track of all registered users on the site.
- ##### tblHospitalPrices
Description: This is the main table of the database.  It lists the prices of procedures and services by hospital and insurer.  Three prcies are included cost, gross charge, and cash discount.

|   Table           |   Field       |   Data Type    |   Description                                          |   Key   |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| tblHospitalPrices | CPT_code      | Int            | Code of specific Procedure or Service                  | Foreign |
| tblHospitalPrices | Hospital_ID   | Int            | Unique Identifier of Hospital                          | Foreign |
| tblHospitalPrices | Insurer_ID    | Int            | Unique Identifier of Insurance Plan                    | Foreign |
| tblHospitalPrices | Cost          | Money          | Insurer's Negotiated Rate for Procedure or Service     |         |
| tblHospitalPrices | Gross_charge  | Money          | Hospital's Undiscounted Sticker Price                  |         |
| tblHospitalPrices | Cash_discount | Decimal        | Discount for Cash Payment Method                       |         | 

Tests to verify: To verify the table is loaded properly we plan to perform the SQL query, `SELECT * FROM tblHospitalPrices;`.  We will then compare this data with the data present in the Excel file located in the DB_XLSX_Files directory.

- ##### tblInsurer
Description: This table lists all of the insurers that we gathered price data for.  It includes two public insurers and four private insurers.
| Table             | Field         | Data Type      | Description                                                        | Key     |

- ##### tblCPT_Codes
Description: CPT codes are standard industry codes that uniquely identify all possible servies or procedures that can be performed on a patient.  We selected a subset of 50 of these codes to include in our project.
| Table             | Field         | Data Type      | Description                                                        | Key     |

Tests to verify: To verify the table is loaded properly we plan to perform the SQL query, `SELECT * FROM tblCPT_Codes;`.  We will then compare this data with the data present in the Excel file located in the DB_XLSX_Files directory.

- ##### users
Description: The final table simply lists users and their associated passwords.
| Table             | Field         | Data Type      | Description                                                        | Key     |

Tests to verify: To verify the table is loaded properly we plan to perform the SQL query, `SELECT * FROM users;`.  This step will be performed after we have used the website to sign up some "dummy" users.

#### List of Data Access Methods
Our website will utilize four methods to access the underlying sqlite database
##### getCPT
Description: This method will be used on the browse by procedure page to pull up a table showing the price of a procedure.  The method executes a SQL query producing a table where rows are populated by hospitals and the columns are populated by rates (insurers, self-pay, charge).

Parameters: The method takes only one parameter, the input from the user contained in the textbox.  The input should be the name of a procedure or CPT code.

Return values: The method will return the results of the SQL query using sqlite's built-in fetchall() function.  A list of tuples is returned which is then processed into an HTML table for display on the webpage.

Use case name: Browse by procedure page / getCPT <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify a variety of searches by different test codes and procedure names. <br>
Description <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify correct results appear and render in the table <br>

Parameters: The method takes only one parameter, the input from the user contained in the textbox.  The input should be the name of an insurer.

Return values: The method will return the results of the SQL query using sqlite's built-in fetchall() function.  A list of tuples is returned which is then processed into an HTML table for display on the webpage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page scrolls correctly with results <br>
Status (Pass/Fail) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass <br>
